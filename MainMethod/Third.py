# import First
 
# print('im from third')  when we do this like it print iported file and following statements


#to avoid this we use if __name__=='__main__' it will exceute the code when we exceute it mainly or directly instead of importing we can also import it by explicitly 

#like 

import First
import Second #here you can see the second module automatically it printing
print('im from third ')
print(First.a)
