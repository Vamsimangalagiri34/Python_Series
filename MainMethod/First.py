# The __pycache__ directory is where Python stores compiled bytecode versions of imported modules to make programs load faster. When a Python file is run and imports other modules, Python compiles those modules into optimized .pyc files and saves them in __pycache__. This way, it can skip re-compiling each time, improving performance.

# Purpose: Speed up loading by using pre-compiled code.
# Safe to Delete: Python will recreate it as needed.
# Best Practice: Often added to .gitignore since it’s system-specific and not needed in version control



# __pycache__ is automatically created by Python to store compiled bytecode of imported modules. This cached bytecode helps Python avoid recompiling modules every time they’re imported, making subsequent runs faster. So, when you run a script again, Python checks __pycache__ for the compiled versions and uses them directly, saving time and resources.
