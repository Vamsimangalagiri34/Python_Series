Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Unpack a Collection 
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
