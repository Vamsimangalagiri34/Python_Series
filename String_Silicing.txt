Slicing
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5]) # llo

Slice From the Start
By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5]) #â€‹Hello

Slice To the End
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

Negative Indexing
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
Example
Get the characters:

From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)

To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])#orl
